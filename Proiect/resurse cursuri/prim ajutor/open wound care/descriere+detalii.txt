Wound Care at Home: Healing Open Wounds

Steps---
1.Wash hands with soap and water
Before touching the wound site, it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
This is to be done to prevent infection on the wound from microbes on the hand.

2. Put on gloves if available
Wearing gloves is added precaution since it checks the spread of germs both ways, from the hand to the wound and vice versa. 
It is important to use only medical grade surgical gloves, found at the local pharmacy, for wound care procedures.

3.Remove the tape over the dressing
Remove the old dressing by gently lifting and peeling off the old tape. 
This is to make sure that the skin underneath does not rupture and start bleeding due to rash removal of the wound dressing.

4.Clean the wound
Gently clean the wound with circular motions from the center to the outer edge. 
Then pat dry. Apply medications prescribed by your doctor, if any. 

5. Dress the wound
Use wound care supplies prescribed by a certified caregiver. 
Place the dressing gently over the wound. Ensure that the entire site is covered.

6. Secure the dressing
Secure the dressing in place with tape. 
It should be medically prescribed and approved by your doctor.
